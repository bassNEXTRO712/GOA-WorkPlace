            <h2>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth</h2>
            <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had att amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup" </p>

            <h3 id="kira_text">Such a life-changing<br> experience. Highly<br> recommended</h3>
            <p id="kira_ph">Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals whe can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enrall by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and stuff did not disappoint. They ware very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the nest level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during Interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!</p>

            <h3>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy. </h3>
            <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people." </p>
