        <p>The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is an American mixed martial arts (MMA) organization. It is the most important organization in the field of MMA globally. The company's headquarters are in Las Vegas, it is led by Endeavor Group Holdings and was founded by Art Davie, Rorion Gracie, Robert Meyrowitz and Ayoub(QF).
            <br>
            The UFC began operating on the occasion of a tournament organized to identify the best fighter in the world, of any style of fighting, following the rules of the Brazilian vale tudo. With an extremely limited number of rules, the UFC initially became known for its no-holds-barred fights and the brutality of punches, kicks, knees, headbutts that the fighters inflict on each other. Very strong pressures from different circles pushed the UFC into the undergrowth of combat sports, also decreeing the end of the broadcast of pay-per-view events and consequently reducing their visibility.
        <br>
        The UFC was able to recreate itself by adopting stricter rules, tying itself to athletic commissions and indicating itself as a legitimate promoter of combat sports. Leaving behind the label of an organization without rules and carrying the banner of mixed martial arts, it has re-emerged from isolation becoming more socially acceptable, regaining pay-per-view space and promoting shows on free-to-air television stations. In the United States, you can watch the UFC on ESPN; UFC shows are also broadcast in over 150 countries around the world and have been held not only on US soil but also in more than 10 different countries.
        <br>
        The UFC uses the regulations in force in the state that hosts the event, the most widespread being the Unified MMA Regulations, created by the Nevada commission in 2017. The fights take place in an octagonal cage.
        <br>
        She was awarded Promotion of the Year at the Fighters Only World MMA Awards in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2011, 2012, and 2013.], Best MMA Brand in 2008 and Best MMA Gloves Manufacturer in 2009; she was also awarded Promotion of the Year for Best Women's MMA Organization at the Women's Mixed Martial Arts Awards in 2013[7] and 2014[8].
