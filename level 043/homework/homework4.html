        <p><b>adidas Fevernova (2002 World Cup)</b> – The first World Cup ball to move away from the Tango template, the Fevernova introduced a fresh new look for adidas, with that fiery graphic. In honesty, it was between this and the Brazuca… But this is a golden ball… the ball David Beckham found redemption with as he slammed it home from the spot against Argentina. Couldn’t not be on the list, could it?</p>

        <h3>adidas Telstar (1970 World Cup) </h3>
        <img id="img2" src="./Pictures/balls-6-min.jpg" alt="">
    <p> adidas Telstar (1970 World Cup) – The first ball to feature a hexagonal/pentagonal design (32 hand stitched panels of 12 black pentagons and 20 white hexagons), the Telstar is now the definition of a football worldwide. Don't believe us? Just check your emojis. Originally introduced to help supporters recognise the ball on their black and white television sets, making it the star of the television. Get it, Tel(evision) Star.</p>

        <h4>adidas Tricolore (1998 World Cup) </h4>
        <p>adidas Tricolore (1998 World Cup) – The final World Cup ball to feature the iconic Tango design, and the first time a colour other than black and white was introduced, with the graphic taking on a blue colouring with hints of red, all on that white base to tie in with the flag that it was named after. Owen slaloming through the Argentinian defence before sumptuously slamming the Tricolore past the stranded keeper, anyone? How about R9 debuting his new boot, the Mercurial, with the ball at his feet? </p>
